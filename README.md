To ensure that my code was functional and secure, I generated JUnit tests to determine that my code was able to do what it was intended to do.
In the JUnit tests, I generated certain conditions to see if the code would act the way in which it was intended to.
The requirements were helpful in generating certain tests as I had to make sure that my code would follow the requirements. 
I had to follow the requirements when generating the code to make sure that I was doing what the company wanted.
If you have a certain set of requirements, it makes generating code a bit easier as you have an idea of what the code should do and what to restrict.
